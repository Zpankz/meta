# meta

Distributed as a reusable skill for the Context-Engineering skill corpus.

## What this is

`meta` is a deterministic governance skill that emits reproducible control-plane artifacts from a skill corpus
(`.index` metadata) for distribution and audit.

## Completion Promise

This repository fulfills a strict, recursive governance synthesis of the provided skill corpus:

- Every skill is normalized into a canonical modular cluster.
- Cross-skill dependencies are emitted as auditable hard/soft edges.
- Compatibility aliases are preserved through `.skill` symlinks.
- Orchestration artifacts are emitted deterministically with MCTSR validation and BD issue ledgers.
- The result is packaged as a plugin-ready, release-validated skill distribution.

## What it provides

- `SKILL.md` with explicit behavior and dependency contracts.
- Cross-platform release tooling with reproducible indexing, ontologies, DAG analysis, and issue-ledger control.
- Compatibility with `npx skills`, `ai-agent-skills`, and Claude plugin marketplace distribution.

## Distribution targets

This repository is designed for:

- `npx skills add <repo>` / `npx ai-agent-skills install <repo>` installation.
- Claude plugin discovery via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

## Quick usage

From the containing corpus root, run:

```bash
python skills/meta/scripts/package_release.py --base . --strict
```

## Build and validation

- Build artifact (per-call):
- `python .index/interfaces/emit_index.py --base .`
- `python skills/meta/scripts/meta_cycle.py --base . --iterations 5 --strict --package`
- `python skills/meta/scripts/meta_cycle.py --base . --iterations 5 --strict --package` (explicit RALPH orchestration form)
- `python skills/meta/scripts/package_release.py --base . --strict` (requires all configured `.index/*` artifacts)
- Validate marketplace manifest:
  - `claude plugin validate .`

## Files

- `skills/meta/` — canonical skill package and interface metadata.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — plugin marketplace manifest for Claude Code plugin consumers.
- `.index/` — deterministic artifact bundle outputs generated by this skill.

## Maintenance

- Housekeeping sync run: 2026-02-15T15:48:00Z (manual update to refresh remote activity metadata).
